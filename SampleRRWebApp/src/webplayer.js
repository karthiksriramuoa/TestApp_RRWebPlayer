import rrwebPlayer from 'rrweb-player';
    
    // Assuming 'events' is the array of recorded events you've obtained
    const replayer = new rrwebPlayer({
      target: document.body, // Specify the target element for the player
      props: {
        events,
        width: 1024, // Set playback width
        height: 768, // Set playback height
      },
    });
    
    
    // This will embed the `rrweb-player` into the `body` of your HTML document and start playing back the recorded sessions.
    
    // ### Important Notes:
    
    // - Make sure the `events` array is correctly populated with the recorded events before initializing `rrweb-player`.
    // - Adjust the `target`, `width`, and `height` properties of the `rrweb-player` initialization to fit your requirements.
    // - For a real-world application, you would likely need to handle the serialization and deserialization of the events array, as it may become quite large and need to be stored externally (e.g., in a database or file system).
    
    // By following these steps, you can record user sessions and play them back with `rrweb` and `rrweb-player`, which can be invaluable for debugging, user experience analysis, and more.
